# Notifications


App created to remind about mysteries of the rosary on current day ;)
Is based on notifications which appears every day just after midnight.
Notification can be expanded to show five different stages of Christ's life.
After pushing the notification you are redirected into default webpage which can be changed


To create this app I had to work with SharedPreferences, PendingIntent, AlarmManager, AlertDialog and NotificationManager.

I do not focus on the appearance of the application.
